# ORIGIN STORY
Back in 2014, @samatt and @antiboredom built [NSHey](https://github.com/samatt/NSHey), a wifi network monitoring tool built on top of [ed: a bunch of unix, you probably don't care]. It was distributed with an x86_64 binary version of the sniffer utility. Worked great if you wanted to run it on a Mac. On a Raspberry Pi, which uses an ARM processor different from the kind in your desktop computer (x86_64), not so much.

We needed the tool that preceeded NSHey.

So, much like the National Security Agency was preceeded by **The Cyphers Bureau**, NSHey comes out of the aftermath of the **Sniffers Bureau**.
